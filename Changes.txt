1) Merged Sachetto changes since 04/06/2020
    - New build using shell-script
    - GPU-CG
    - ODE adaptative
    - Save activation_time and APD on ".acm"
 
2) Lucas improvements
    - Organize the /example_configs folder in categories
    - Organize the /scripts folder in categories
    - Organize the /networks folder in categories
    - Organize the /meshes folder in categories
    - Add Fedora build options to the "build.sh"
    - It is now possible to set the conductivity of each segment from a Purkinje network
    - Revamped the Purkinje-Coupling code. The PMJ current equation now follows the idea from the CARPentry solver:
        https://carpentry.medunigraz.at/carputils/examples/tutorials/tutorials.02_EP_tissue.19_Pkje.run.html
    - Purkinje-Coupling simulations can now store LAT and APD maps in VTU/VTP.
    - The active PMJs of a Purkinje network can now be given in VTK format. The default case considers all the PMJs as active.
    - Add Trovato_2019 Purkinje cellular model.
    - Update the DFS function for the Purkinje mesh construction, so that cycles are avoided.
    - Add an unitary test for the Purkinje network, which tests if there is duplicate nodes on the mesh graph.
    - New examples have been added

3) Bugs
    - When "compress=true" the meshes are not right.
